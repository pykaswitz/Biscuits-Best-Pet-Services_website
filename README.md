# Biscuits-Best-Pet-Services_website
Using Bootstrap 4.5 to create first website for a client.

Used a template and Bootstrap to create this website.  It is my attempt to learn Bootstrap while also learning to code HTML/CSS/JS and Python.

I will also setup a domain and run as web admin.

Hoping to use this experience to learn and grow as a web developer, and as I learn new skills I hope to update this website over time to become better and less reliant on frameworks and templates.
